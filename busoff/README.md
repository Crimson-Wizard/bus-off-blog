![image of the header and navigation bar](</readme images/home-page-imgs/Header-nav.png>)

Given that the home page will feature a stunning banner design created by Josie, I decided to keep the header logo subtle and understated. The goal was to ensure that the logo complements the banner without overshadowing it, maintaining a clean and elegant aesthetic.

**Header Key Considerations:**

- Discreet Design: The logo was intentionally designed to be discreet, allowing the banner to take center stage. This choice ensures that the focus remains on the beautiful visuals that set the tone for the entire site.

- Balanced Aesthetic: By opting for a smaller, less intrusive logo, the header maintains a harmonious balance with the rest of the page elements, contributing to a cohesive and visually pleasing user experience.

- User-Friendly Navigation: Despite its subtlety, the logo remains easily identifiable and serves its purpose without overwhelming the user, ensuring that navigation remains intuitive.

The website features a responsive navigation bar that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal browsing experience across all devices.

**Navigation Bar Key Features:**

- Bold Active Page Indicator: The navigation bar highlights the current page by rendering its link in bold. This provides a clear visual cue to the user, making it easy to identify which page they are currently viewing.

- Responsive Design: On smaller screens, the navigation bar condenses into a sleek "burger" menu. This collapsible menu maintains easy access to all site navigation options while conserving valuable screen space on mobile devices.

- User-Friendly Navigation: The combination of bold indicators for active pages and a responsive design ensures that users can navigate the site effortlessly, regardless of the device they are using.

This responsive design approach not only enhances the user experience but also ensures that the website remains accessible and intuitive across a variety of screen sizes.

**User Account Status:**

- Logged In: On the right side of the navigation bar, users who are logged in will see a message confirming their logged-in status. This ensures that users are always aware of their current session.

- Logged Out: If a user is not logged in, the navigation bar will prompt them to either log in or register for an account. This makes it easy for new users to get started and for returning users to access their accounts quickly.

- Dynamic Content: The content displayed on the right side of the navigation bar dynamically changes based on the user's status. This personalized approach enhances user experience by providing the most relevant options at any given time.

- Easy Access to Account Management: Whether it’s logging in, registering, or managing an existing account, the navigation bar ensures that users have quick access to these essential features.

  - Inventory Management: The backend will include tools for Josie to manage inventory, track orders, and update product listings easily, ensuring that the store runs efficiently and stays up to date.

## Testing

**Automated Testing**
In addition to manual testing, I employed Django's automated testing framework to ensure the functionality and reliability of the views and models on the Blog and About pages.

**Testing Approach:**

- Django's Automated Testing:
  - Views: I wrote and executed automated tests to verify that the views on the Blog and About pages are functioning as expected. These tests ensured that each view correctly renders the appropriate template, handles requests, and returns the expected HTTP status codes.

  - Models: Automated tests were also used to validate the behavior and integrity of the models associated with the Blog and About pages. This included testing model methods, relationships, and field validations to ensure that the data is correctly managed and stored.

**Benefits of Automated Testing:**

    - Efficiency: Automated testing allowed for rapid and repeated testing of key functionalities, ensuring that the core components of the site work correctly after every change or update.

    - Reliability: By using Django's testing framework, I was able to catch and resolve issues early in the development process, reducing the likelihood of bugs or errors making it to the production environment.

    - Consistency: Automated tests provide a consistent way to validate the functionality of the site, helping to maintain the quality of the codebase over time.

**Summary:**

Django's automated testing tools were instrumental in verifying the functionality of the views and models on the Blog and About pages. These tests complemented the manual testing efforts, providing a robust and reliable foundation for the site's ongoing development and maintenance.

**Manual Testing**
To ensure a seamless user experience, I conducted thorough manual testing of the site. This process involved systematically going through each input field and deliberately entering incorrect or unexpected data to observe the outcomes.

**Testing Approach:**

- Input Validation: By testing each form and input field with various types of invalid data, such as incorrect formats, out-of-range values, and missing required fields, I was able to identify and correct any issues that could potentially disrupt the user experience.

- Specific Tests:

  - Videos in Image Folders: Tested scenarios where users might attempt to upload videos in image-only upload fields, ensuring that appropriate error messages are displayed and the upload is prevented.

  - Emails Without Email Format: Entered names or text without email formatting in email input fields to ensure that the site rejects such inputs and prompts the user to provide a valid email address.

  - Blank Name and Email Fields: Checked forms with blank name and email fields to ensure that the site requires these fields to be filled out, providing appropriate prompts for users to enter the necessary information.

- Functionality Testing: I verified that all interactive elements of the site, including submit, edit, and delete buttons, functioned as expected. This included ensuring that:

  - Confirmation Before Irreversible Actions: The site issues clear warnings before any irreversible changes are made, such as deleting content, to prevent accidental data loss.

  - Comment Moderation: Comments do not get posted without approval, ensuring that all user-generated content is moderated before being displayed publicly.

- User Experience: Throughout the testing process, I focused on ensuring that the site remained intuitive and user-friendly, even when users encountered errors. The goal was to make sure that no aspect of the user experience was hindered, and that users were guided in the right direction when issues arose.

**Outcomes and Issues:**
The manual testing process was crucial in refining the site’s input validation, functionality, and error handling mechanisms, ensuring that users can interact with the site smoothly and without unnecessary interruptions. During testing, I identified a few issues, which are documented in the Bugs Section. These findings were addressed to enhance the overall reliability and usability of the site.

## Bugs

**Bug: Mixing Class-Based and Function-Based Views**
I encountered a bug when I mistakenly mixed a class-based view with a function-based view in the same context, leading to confusion and rendering issues. Additionally, I used incorrect syntax in the template by writing `{{% %}}` instead of `{% %}`, which caused further errors. To resolve the issue, I opted for a function-based view and corrected the template syntax, ensuring the data iterated correctly and the page rendered as intended.

**Bug: Image Upload Issues in Media Gallery**
I encountered an issue when trying to upload images to the media gallery, receiving an error related to a null value in the "image" column: null value in column "image" of relation "media_media" violates not-null constraint. The problem was caused by a default=placeholder setting, which was inappropriate for a gallery meant to display specific images. To resolve the issue, I removed the default=placeholder, allowing the gallery to correctly handle the image uploads

**Bug: Edit Button and Missing JavaScript File**
I encountered an issue where the edit button was not functioning properly, and the console displayed a `GET http://localhost:8000/static/js/comments.js net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)` error. After thoroughly checking the code, I discovered that the `comments.js` file was not stored in the `staticfiles` directory. Once I moved the file to the correct directory, the issue was resolved.

**Automated Test Adjustment**
While running automated tests on the Blog and About views and forms, I encountered an error in a test case where the expected content didn't match the actual response. Specifically, the test was checking for the message `b'Collaboration request received! I aim to reply within two days'`, but the content differed. To resolve this, I updated the test parameters to match the correct statement, ensuring that the test accurately reflects the expected behavior.

**Image Upload Testing Issue**
During testing, I discovered that attempting to upload a video instead of an image resulted in an error. To address this, I created a custom form with a function that checks the `content_type` of the file being uploaded, ensuring that only image files are allowed. If a user attempts to upload a non-image file, an error message stating "Only image files are allowed." is displayed. This validation was implemented both in the media gallery and the blog application to ensure consistent and proper file handling across the site.

**Bug: HTML Rendering in Comments**
During testing, I noticed that HTML tags were being rendered in the Django admin and displayed in the comments on the site, but not when comments were submitted through the form on the site. To resolve this, I used the `safe` filter to clean the content before it is rendered on the blog page, ensuring that HTML is displayed correctly. After struggling to find a solution through various searches, I turned to ChatGPT for assistance. With its help, I was able to work through the code, identify the error, and implement a fix. I believe AI tools like ChatGPT are invaluable for troubleshooting and problem-solving, especially when working solo, as long as they are used as an aid to enhance, not replace, the development process.
